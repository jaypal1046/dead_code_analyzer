## 1.0.6

- Updated `README.md` to reflect the current regex-based implementation of Dead Code Analyzer.
- Clarified that the tool uses regex for reference counting.
- Added known limitation for constructor reference counting (e.g., classes like `Active` may show incorrect `internal references: 1`).
- Included instructions for using `--verbose` to debug reference issues.
- Added support for multiple projects and flavored `main` functions in usage examples and best practices.
- Introduced a sample pie chart for visualizing unused elements breakdown.
- Updated example output to include `Active`, `StateFullClass`, and `myFunction` from recent fixes.
- Attempted fix for constructor reference counting in `usage_analyzer.dart` by updating `constructorDefRegex` for multi-line named parameters and adding a fallback regex in `_filterNonCommentMatches`.

## 1.0.5

- Fix the comment function not found and added test case for comment function handling

## 1.0.4

- Fix the class comment not found and added test case for class handling

## 1.0.3

- updated README.md

## 1.0.2

- Added support for excluding specific Dart SDK versions in analysis to avoid false positives with experimental features like macros.
- Improved error messages for dependency conflicts, providing clearer guidance on resolving `analyzer` and `macros` issues.
- Added `--version` flag to display the tool’s version in the CLI.
- Fixed dependency conflict with `freezed >=2.5.3` by updating `analyzer` to `^6.9.0`, ensuring compatibility with `macros >=0.1.3-main.0`.
- Updated `pubspec.yaml` to require Dart SDK `>=3.3.0 <4.0.0` with `enable-experiments: macros`.
- Improved documentation in `README.md` to clarify publishing status for Pub badges.

## 1.0.1

- Fixed Pub Version and Package Publisher badges in `README.md` by ensuring correct package name and version on `pub.dev`.
- Added missing `LICENSE` file to repository, enabling License badge to display “BSD-3-Clause”.
- Fixed typo in CLI help message for `--exclude` option description.
